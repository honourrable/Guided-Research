# Guided Research 1

## The Outline of the Course

1. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approach, non-personalized recommendations, kNN
2. Explicit rating vs. implicit feedback
3. Latent factor models. Factorization models
4. Explicit ratings: SVD++ and timeSVD++
5. Implicit feedback – MF (negative sampling), WRMF
6. Empirical analysis
7. Empirical analysis-2
8. Loss types, learning to rank – BPR
9. Evaluation metrics, and Beyond accuracy – coverage, novelty, serendipity, diversity, persistency
10. Empirical analysis of RS algorithms
11. Advanced topics – cold start, incorporate user preferences
12. Multiple feedback types, context aware recommendations
13. Block Chain Based Recommender Systems
